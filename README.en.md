## Configuration

The site is hosted using Netlify.

Primarily, it processes on the front-end using Vue.js, but the [Browsing Environment](https://tools.foresuke.com/client-info) screen uses an external API ([ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/)) to obtain approximate regional information from the IP address.  
To prevent CORS errors, it calls the external API via Netlify functions.

Confidential information is specified as environment variables in Netlify.  
The specified items are as follows:

| Key | Sample Value | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| IPINFO_API_TOKEN | YOUR_IPINFO_API_TOKEN | Token used when calling ipinfo.io | 
| VUE_APP_AUTHOR | hoge | Author name. Displayed in the browser's developer console | 
| VUE_APP_GA_TRACKING_ID | G-xxxxxxx | Google Analytics Tracking ID | 
| VUE_APP_NETLIFY_FUNCTION_DOMAIN | https://hogehoge.netlify.app | Backend (Netlify functions) endpoint |
